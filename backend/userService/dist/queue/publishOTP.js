    Backpressure occurs when the producer (sender) is sending data faster than the consumer (receiver) or system can process or handle.
    Where You Encounter Backpressure:
      1. Streams in Node.js	Writable stream‚Äôs internal buffer fills up
      2. RabbitMQ (amqplib)	Channel's internal TCP buffer is full
      3  HTTP APIs	Too many requests, the server responds slowly
      4.  File writes	Disk I/O slower than write rate
